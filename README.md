## Predict the city affiliation of a Dutch neighbourhood

Using the neighbourhood dataset of Statistics Netherlands (CBS) [1], predict which city a neighbourhood belongs to based on its statistics. Imagine that you are playing a game, where one person tells only the statistics of a neighbourhood (e.g. 30,000 inhabitants, and 20% is over 65 years old etc.), and the other person has to predict which city this neighbourhood is from. You will focus on distinguishing between the following cities: Rotterdam, Lelystad, and Venlo. These cities are chosen, as they are quite different from each other, while they have a similar number of neighbourhoods.
